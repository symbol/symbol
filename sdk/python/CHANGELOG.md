## [3.2.2] - 28-May-2024

### Added
- use sphinx to generate basic readthedocs-style class level documentation
- add additional Symbol address utilities
  - create address alias from namespace id
  - extract namespace id from address alias
  - create address from decoded address hex string (REST format)
-  add metadata_generate_key() since there is no built-in way to convert a string to a metadata key.
- Added SymbolAccount class
  - add sign_transaction() to the SymbolAccount to match facade functionality
  - add cosign_transaction() to the SymbolAccount to match facade functionality
  - to improve discoverability, add a helper function(message_encoder) to SymbolAccount, which creates a MessageEncoder used to encrypt/encode messages
- add SymbolPublicAccount class
  - add properties address and publicKey for better discoverability
- Added NemAccount class
  - add sign_transaction() to the NemAccount to match facade functionality
  - to improve discoverability, add a helper function(message_encoder) to NemAccount, which creates a MessageEncoder used to encrypt/encode messages
- Add NemPublicAccount class
  - add properties address and publicKey for better discoverability
  - add a create_public_account() and create_account() to the facade for both NEM and Symbol
- add deserialize() function to TransactionFactory in SDK for better discoverability
