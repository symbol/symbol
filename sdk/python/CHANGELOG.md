## [3.2.3] - 04-Dec-2024

### Added
- add to_json() to the generated model classes to get a JSON-safe representation of the model.
- add extract_signing_payload() to facade to get signing payload which allows signing by hardware keys.
- add cosign_transaction_hash() to facade and account to allow cosigning of transaction hash.

### Changed
- (BREAKING NEM) NEM cosignature transaction multisig_transaction_hash field renamed to other_transaction_hash

### Fixed
- (NEM) add non-verifiable cosignature transaction to allow signing of the cosignature transaction.

## [3.2.2] - 28-May-2024

### Added
- use sphinx to generate basic readthedocs-style class level documentation
- add additional Symbol address utilities
  - create address alias from namespace id
  - extract namespace id from address alias
  - create address from decoded address hex string (REST format)
-  add metadata_generate_key() since there is no built-in way to convert a string to a metadata key.
- Added SymbolAccount class
  - add sign_transaction() to the SymbolAccount to match facade functionality
  - add cosign_transaction() to the SymbolAccount to match facade functionality
  - to improve discoverability, add a helper function(message_encoder) to SymbolAccount, which creates a MessageEncoder used to encrypt/encode messages
- add SymbolPublicAccount class
  - add properties address and publicKey for better discoverability
- Added NemAccount class
  - add sign_transaction() to the NemAccount to match facade functionality
  - to improve discoverability, add a helper function(message_encoder) to NemAccount, which creates a MessageEncoder used to encrypt/encode messages
- Add NemPublicAccount class
  - add properties address and publicKey for better discoverability
  - add a create_public_account() and create_account() to the facade for both NEM and Symbol
- add deserialize() function to TransactionFactory in SDK for better discoverability
