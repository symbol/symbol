### Cross-chain swaps

Symbol's _secret lock_ and _secret proof_ can be compared to hashed timelock contract in other blockchains. Thanks to them cross-chain swaps can be made.

#### Example: ETH⟷XYM cross-chain swap

To make cross chain swap with Ethereum there's a contract needed. Exemplary contract is available in https://github.com/gimre-xymcity/hashed-timelock-contract-ethereum.

:::warning
This contract is not production ready.
Few things that should be taken care of:
 * timing lock/contract expiry is crucial for security of both parties (see explanation after _Guts_)
 * due to gas involved, ETH contract should use sha3 instead of double sha256,
 * unfortunately, sha3 opcode in EVM is actually keccak256,
 * although Symbol uses sha3 it does not older variant usually referred to as keccak, `Op_Sha3_256` lock type is actual sha3 not keccak; adding keccak would require fork

Contract has been deployed on Sepolia testnet under address [0xd58e030bd21c7788897aE5Ea845DaBA936e91D2B](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xd58e030bd21c7788897ae5ea845daba936e91d2b).

The contract contains following methods, that will be used:
 1. `newContract(address receiver, bytes32 lock, uint timelock)` - creates new lock where destination account is `receiver`, `lock` is a secret lock, and `timelock` is unix epoch-based timestap limit, until which withdrawal is possible - this is almost 1-to-1 Symbol's `secret lock transaction`
 2. `withdraw(bytes32 contractId, bytes preimage)` - allows to withdraw funds given valid `preimage`; note, that this method must be called by whoever is `receiver` in 1. - this is similar to Symbol's `secret proof transaction`, although Symbol allows sending it from unrelated account, but it's still `receiver` that will get the funds
 3. `refund(bytes32 contractId)` - available after lock expires, only owner of a lock can call it to refund what's inside the lock - in Symbol refund happens automatically after lock expires and generates `BalanceChangeReceipt` within a block with type `LockSecret_Expired`.

There are multiple scenarios, how cross-chain swap scenario can look like, the following is just an example. We have two parties Alice and Bob, with following addresses:

| | ETH | Symbol |
|--- |--- |--- |
| Alice | **0xa11ce**c3497B522a25c08Dd45Cc07663311E04f10 | **TALICE**CI35BNIJQA5CNUKI2DY3SXNEHPZJSOVAA |
| Bob | **0xb0bb1**2D1befe54Dc773CefE7BB3687c72a33d335 | **TBOBBY**KOYQBWK3HSX7NQVJ5JFPE22352AVDXXAA |

**Scenario:**
 1. in Ethereum: **0xa11ce** creates a new lock via `newContract` call with `receiver` = **0xb0bb1**, only Alice knows the preimage (proof) to a used `lock`
 2. in Symbol: **TBOBBY** creates _secret lock_ with recipient set to **TALICE**, Bob is using SAME lock value as Alice;<br> note, this lock should have duration that will expire a bit before lock created by Alice in Ethereum
 3. in Symbol: Alice withdrawals funds by issuing _secret proof_ with a proper preimage
 4. in Ethereum: Bob learned preimage from proof published in Symbol network so he can now call `withdraw` in ethereum

**Guts:**

Finally some hands-on. For ethereum, example below will use tools from [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolkit.

Alice will swap 0.2 ETH with Bob for 7887 XYM.

1. Alice creates a lock:<br>`cast send --value 0.2ether 0xd58e030bd21c7788897aE5Ea845DaBA936e91D2B 'newContract(address,bytes32,uint)' 0xb0bb12D1befe54Dc773CefE7BB3687c72a33d335 b867db875479bcc0287352cdaa4a1755689b8338777d0915e9acd9f6edbc96cb 1663568700`
	1. [0xd58e030bd21c7788897aE5Ea845DaBA936e91D2B](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xd58e030bd21c7788897ae5ea845daba936e91d2b) is the contract address mentioned earlier
	2. **0xb0bb1**2D1befe54Dc773CefE7BB3687c72a33d335 - is bob eth destination,
	3. b867…96cb - is the lock value,
	4. finally 1663568700 is a timestamp corresponding to _Monday, 19 September 2022 06:25:00_ GMT,
	5. corresponding tx on Sepolia testnet: [0x23265e1a9aaaa70d582369fd3edbbe20b2f44a3a18a0a96205fb8beac8689964](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x23265e1a9aaaa70d582369fd3edbbe20b2f44a3a18a0a96205fb8beac8689964),
	6. as can be seen in transaction logs, `contractId` (read: identifier of created lock) is `0x81b0f164348bb17de94cca31b8d41ce435321aa2bb5721eb5c90cadd886e4c3f`
2. Bob creates lock inside Symbol:
	1. First bob needs to turn Alice's timelock into secret lock duration.
	2. Current testnet block at the time of writing is **697357**, with network timestamp: **25407256928**.
	3. Alice's unix epoch-based timestamp needs to be converted to Symbol network timestamp, additionally, we want to lower it by two hours, so that lock in Symbol expires prior to corresponding lock in eth (see explanation below)
	   ```python
	   timelock_datetime = datetime.fromtimestamp(unix_epoch_timelock, tz=timezone.utc)
	   symbol_timestamp = facade.network.from_datetime(timelock_datetime)
	   symbol_timestamp.add_hours(-2)
	   ```
	4. Produced network timestamp needs to be turned into block-based duration. Network timestamps are in milliseconds, so difference needs to be divided by 1000. Symbol testnet network block generation target time is 30s, so to obtain number of blocks:
	   ```python
	   duration = int((symbol_timestamp.timestamp - 25407256928) / 1000 / 30)
	   # (25719853000 - 25407256928) / 1000 / 30 = 10419
	   ```
	5. Finally Bob can create secret lock
		!example create_secret_lock
3. Now Alice can claim the lock, that part is substantially easier:
	1. create secret proof (withdraw)
		!example create_secret_proof
4. Now that Bob has learned super complicated proof he can use contract's `withdraw` method:<br>`cast send 0xd58e030bd21c7788897aE5Ea845DaBA936e91D2B 'withdraw(bytes32, bytes)' 0x81b0f164348bb17de94cca31b8d41ce435321aa2bb5721eb5c90cadd886e4c3f 636F727265637420686F727365206261747465727920737461706C65`
	1. `0xd58e030bd21c7788897aE5Ea845DaBA936e91D2B` is a contract address, the same one as used by Alice,
	2. `0x81b0f164348bb17de94cca31b8d41ce435321aa2bb5721eb5c90cadd886e4c3f` is a lock contract id (`contractId`),
	3. `636F727265637420686F727365206261747465727920737461706C65` - i.e. found in Symbol's testnet explorer (from earlier),
	4. corresponding transaction on Sepolia testnet: `0x14eef724a76ae2aa29b0c405cbc0da2af3c7827e198bfdbbdadbb27eb67a2c05`
5. And they lived happily ever after.

As mentioned in 2.3 lock created in symbol should be _slightly_ shorter. If it would be longer, or in general if ETH timelock will expire before Symbol's lock, Alice could cheat Bob, simply by waiting until eth timelock expires and then publishing both:
 * withdraw (secret proof transaction) inside Symbol network
 * calling `refund(...)` method inside Ethereum network.
