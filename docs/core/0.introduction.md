## Comparisons

Most users will compare Symbol to one of the two major blockchain protocols: Bitcoin (a non-turing complete platform) or Ethereum (a turing complete platform). It's important to understand that blockchains are *tools*, and as a developer you want to pick the right tool for the right job.

However, high-level comparisons can always be helpful for both researchers and developers. Here's how Symbol compares to both.

### Bitcoin

Bitcoin is focused on being *the best money*.

### Ethereum

Ethereum is focused on being *a global compute platform*. Its main innovation is the 'EVM' - the Ethereum Virtual Machine. [...]

However, a turing complete platform introduces unintended security risks and backdoors [...]

### Symbol

Symbol is designed to sit between Bitcoin and Ethereum - it focuses on allowing you to *plug-in* a decentralized ledger into your existing applications, and allows you to build on-chain applications with predictable behaviors and outcomes.
