## Accounts

Accounts are addresses on Symbol that can hold mosaics, metadata and namespaces. Every user or node on the network is defined by one (or more) accounts.

### Tutorial: Creating an Account

Create a random account for a network by creating a `SymbolFacade` of the desired network. For most instances, it should be created around the name of a well-known network: "mainnet" or "testnet". All examples in this guide will use `SymbolNetwork("testnet")`

!example create_random_account

example output:
```
    address: TCEVUET3MJE73F2VG6G3LRWKZN4A3DLX4WJ5XBA
 public key: D1CBF707D990A8C08C3EF68EFECF25B684934C16D9C8BE8B32D34DC511F13070
private key: 91597A3C1FD648D630FEEB339351C168D0581F46F07FA13277F26D5EE0D40283
```

Alternatively, a seed phrase can be used (or randomly generated) and used to derive accounts.

!example create_random_bip32_account

example output:
```

### Tutorial: Querying the Balance of an Account

Account state can be easily queried using `/accounts/<account-id>` identifier.

**Query by address:**
```sh
curl https://${SYMBOL_API_NODE}:3001/accounts/TA4RYHMNHCFRCT2PCWOCJMWVAQ3ZCJDOTF2SGBI
```

**Query by public key:**
```sh
curl https://${SYMBOL_API_NODE}:3001/accounts/23AC0770A1060241604A8E60A47166E3E5B4034D4EE321DBE19B342E85B21544
```

Getting actual balance in a generic fashion is a bit more complicated.

First network currency id needs to be retrieved.
!example get_network_currency

Next to get currency mosaic divisibility, mosaic properties needs to be retrieved.
!example get_mosaic_properties

Finally account state can be queried and all pieces can glued together. `account.mosaics` needs to be searched for currency. Additionally amount is formatted using obtained mosaic divisibility.

!example get_account_state
!example get_account_balance

### Tutorial: Adding or Modifying (Account) Metadata

Account can have assigned metadata. Metadata is assigned to address and either can be assigned via _own_ account or via some other account.
However, to avoid spamming account metadata by third parties, `account metadata transaction` needs to always be wrapped in an aggregate (therefore it automatically requires account owner's cosignature).

Note, account metadata, as well as other kinds of metadata transactions, are designed to attach data that _might_ change in future, good examples are things like home webpage URI, avatar, etc.

There might be better ways to store (or simply encode) the data that is not expected to change.

**Assigning metadata to own account:**

!example create_account_metadata_new

**Modifying existing metadata:**

When changing/updating existing data, passed value needs to be "xor" result of old and new values, there's a helper for that
!py symbolchain.symbol.Metadata.metadata_update_value
!js symbol.metadata.metadataUpdateValue

!example create_account_metadata_modify

### Tutorial: Adding, Modifying or Removing a Cosignatory

In Symbol an account can be turned into multisig account using `multisig account modification` transaction. Modification requires cosignatures of all involved parties, so multisig account modification transactions is only allowed as a transaction within aggregate transaction.

To actually cosign transactions, private keys of cosignatories are needed. In example below, the code has access to all private keys, of course, in reality every cosignatory will need to cosign on their own.

Moreover, example below uses _simpler_ aggregate complete, when if there are different cosignatories, it would be much more convenient to use aggregate bonded transaction (TODO: explain why it's easier to cosign bonded tx)

Transaction preparation can be split into three phases:
 1. preparations of multisig account and cosignatories,
 2. transaction preparation - important part here is to sign aggregate prior to adding cosignatures,
 3. adding cosignatures - this part might look bit weird, that is because it needs to convert some of SDK types into low-level catbuffer types from `symbolchain.sc` module.

!example create_multisig_account_modification_new_account

After this transaction 2-of-3 cosignatories are required to make any transaction, same goes for removal from multisig, due to `min_removal_delta`.

Following example shows how two of cosignatories can swap third one for some other one. Additionally altering amount of cosignatories required for removal (`min_removal_delta`) - example is bit artificial, cause in effect single cosignatory can remove all others, which makes multisig account quite insecure.

!example create_multisig_account_modification_modify_account

Note, that the aggregate transaction is signed by `cosignatory[0]` key pair, but "signer" (or rather _sender_) of the modification transaction is `multisig_key_pair`.

Cosignature of a cosignatory that is added to multisig is ALWAYS required, independent of current settings of `min_approval` or `min_removal`. Reason for this is pretty straightforward, newly added account must "agree" to actually become cosignatory.

### Tutorial: Vanity Generation and You

Addresses are produced from account's public key, exact format is described inside [technical reference](https://github.com/symbol/symbol-technicalref). It's only important to note, that address is a result of applying [one-way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function) on public key.
Raw symbol addresses are 24-bytes long with first byte indicating network type; for display/presentation purposes raw addresses are passed through [base32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32) encoding.

Combining those informations, usually addresses will look random, like so: `NDR6EW2WBHJQDYMNGFX2UBZHMMZC5PGL2YCZOQQ`

There are two _vanity generators_ within symbol, which you can use to search for addresses that contain certain substring.
In general every vanity generator works by searching for random secret keys, then producing public keys, then producing addresses and matching against user supplied string.

The two vanity generators are:
 * first one that is available in [symbol/product/tools/vanity](https://github.com/symbol/product),
 * second comes with catapult client, it's called `catapult.tools.addressgen`.

Note, currently both vanity generators provide BIP-39 mnemonic which can be used in wallet apps.

1. **product/tools/vanity** - this generator is a python script, that is supposed to be called as a module:
   ```shell
   $ cd symbol/product/tools/vanity
   $ python -m vanity --blockchain symbol --network testnet --patterns HELLO --format pretty
   address (testnet): TAHELLOCN5XFWRIAWKSPPYMATZHGXTJEI52NGBQ

            mnemonic: twice despair october tenant swamp second harvest lens mom violin catch response naive stomach divorce captain humble kite income ranch help bacon asthma enhance

   It can search for multiple strings at once:

2. **catapult.tools.addressgen**, example invocation:

   While searching for 5 chars might finish in few minutes, search time increases exponentially with every    character. Searching for strings containing characters outside of base32 alphabet (i.e. `0`, `1`, `8`,    `9`) will never finish.

   Due to how base32 encoding works, the only available prefixes in mainnet are `NA, NB, NC, ND`, to    search starting at the beginning of an address prefix input with a caret sign `^`:
   ```shell
   $ ./bin/catapult.tools.addressgen --network mainnet --input ^NAHELL
        address (mainnet): NAHELLACJKBYBQGQ7ZGLOOYDFWKE2ZSWB3A3HDQ
