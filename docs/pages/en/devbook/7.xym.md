## XYM

XYM is the base-layer currency of Symbol. Any activity on the blockchain - from recording data to sending assets or messages - requires a small fee of XYM, which rewards validators who create and finalize blocks.

### Tutorial: Querying XYM Supply
Maximum supply is the maximum number of XYM that can ever be minted.
```sh
curl https://${SYMBOL_API_NODE}:3001/network/currency/supply/max
```
!example get_maximum_supply

Total supply is the number of XYM minted to date.
```sh
curl https://${SYMBOL_API_NODE}:3001/network/currency/supply/total
```
!example get_total_supply

Circulating supply is the number of XYM minted to date, excluding the balances of the two fee sinks:
1. VORTEX4: Mosaic and namespace rental fee sink
2. VORTEX3: Network fee sink

```sh
curl https://${SYMBOL_API_NODE}:3001/network/currency/supply/circulating
```
!example get_circulating_supply
