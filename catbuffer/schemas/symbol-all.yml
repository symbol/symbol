    An AggregateBondedTransaction consumes network resources as it is stored in every
    node''s partial cache while it waits to be fully signed. To avoid spam attacks
    a HashLockTransaction must be announced and confirmed before an AggregateBondedTransaction
    can be announced. The HashLockTransaction locks a certain amount of funds (**10**
    XYM by default) until the aggregate is signed.

    Upon completion of the aggregate, the locked funds become available again to the
    account that signed the HashLockTransaction.

    If the lock expires before the aggregate is signed by all cosignatories (**48h
    by default), the locked funds become a reward collected by the block harvester
    at the height where the lock expires.

    \note It is not necessary to sign the aggregate and its HashLockTransaction with
    the same account. For example, if Bob wants to announce an aggregate and does
    not have enough funds to announce a HashLockTransaction, he can ask Alice to announce
    the lock transaction for him by sharing the signed AggregateTransaction hash.'
