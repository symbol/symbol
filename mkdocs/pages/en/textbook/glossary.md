    This is important in case of <DeFi:> markets, where gains can be made from frontrunning.

HTLC

    The consensus protocol used by <NIS1:>. Similar to <PoS:> but measuring an account's activity besides its stake.

PoS
:   Proof of Stake. A consensus protocol, used, for example, by Ethereum.

PoS+
:   Proof-of-Stake Plus. Symbol's consensus mechanism.

    The chance that accounts will have to harvest a block is calculated through their importance scores.

PoW
:   Proof of Work. A consensus protocol, used, for example, by Bitcoin.

Rollback
:   The act of undoing a blockchain block that was previously confirmed, and reverting all its transactions.

Rug Pull
:   A malicious maneuver where cryptocurrency developers abandon a project and run off with the funds.

Sandwich
:   A type of <MEV:> technique that is popular in <DeFi:>.
    To make a sandwich, you find a pending transaction in the network and then try to surround it by placing one order
    *just* before the transaction (<frontrunning:>) and one order just after it (<backrunning:>).
