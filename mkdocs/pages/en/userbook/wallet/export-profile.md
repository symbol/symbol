# Exporting a Profile

This page explains how to export a <profile:> and all the accounts it contains from the Symbol Desktop Wallet.  
Exporting a profile lets you create a backup or use the same accounts on another device by [importing the profile](./import-profile.md) there.

The Symbol Desktop Wallet exports profiles as paper wallets:

Paper Wallet
:   A printable document containing information to restore a wallet profile and all its accounts.

    The information is intended to be printed on paper and may include QR codes, <key pair:|private keys>,
    <mnemonic phrase:|mnemonic phrases>, or all of them.

    Paper wallets are less convenient than digital backups because the information must be entered manually.  
    However, they are more secure since they are not stored or accessed online.

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you have installed the Symbol Desktop Wallet.  
If you havenâ€™t done that yet, see the [Installing the Wallet](./install.md) guide.

* You must already have a profile set up in the Symbol Desktop Wallet, either by [creating a new one](./create-profile.md) or [importing an existing one](./import-profile.md).
