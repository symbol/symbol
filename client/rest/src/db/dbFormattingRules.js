/**
 * Some of the formatters here may be branched depending on whether the received data comes from MongoDb or simple JavaScript. This happens
 * because those formatters take data from the database and expose it to the API, and in some uncommon cases, data is fabricated outside of
 * the database environment, and is then exposed to the API, however, the underlying types are not those of the databse. This architecture
 * couples the database and the API a great deal, and this would probably need to be decoupled into two stages/layers (database parsing, and
 * internal objects parsing). However, since the vast majority of times data is streamed directly untouched from the database to the API,
 * this has not been decoupled yet.
