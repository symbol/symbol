# Developer Notes

This document is intended for readers interested in catapult-client development.

## Hardware requirements

The scripts shared in these documents have been tested on servers with the following hardware:

* CPU: 4 cores, with **little endian** architecture
* Memory: 8 GB
* HD: 20 GB

Runtime server requirements are network dependent.
For example, networks with higher throughput will likely have higher requirements.

Although you might be able to run the software in less powerful instances, you might encounter some issues while installing or running the node.

## Port requirements

The port ``7900`` is required by catapult-client to communicate between nodes.
Make sure that the node's host is accessible from the internet and that the port is open and available.

## Building catapult-client

### Prerequisites

Required

* cmake >= 3.23
* git
* python 3.x

Recommended

* ninja-build

### Compilers

Catapult's supported compilers are:

Linux:

* Clang: 11.0.1
* Clang: 10.0.0
* GCC: 10.2.0
* GCC: 9.2.1

OS X:

* Apple Clang: 11.0.3

Windows:

* Visual Studio 2019 (16.8)
* Visual Studio 2022 (17.9)

### Guides

In increasing order of complexity:

* [Build with Docker](BUILD-docker.md)
* [Build with Conan](BUILD-conan.md)
* [Build with Visual Studio](BUILD-vs.md) (*easiest for Windows users on VS integrated with CMake)
* [Build manually](BUILD-manual.md)

### Sanitizers

There are a few false positives when running sanitizers on targets
compiled with clang 9.
When building sanitizers, `sanitizer_blacklist.txt` file is used.

When running thread sanitizer, there are following suppressions required:

* for false positive in libc++ `shared_ptr`:
* for false positive in boost's 1.74 executor (ref-counted)
* for false positive in boost logger, in server logger is always initialized from a single thread

```suppresions
race:~weak_ptr
race:~executor
race:global_logger::get()
```
